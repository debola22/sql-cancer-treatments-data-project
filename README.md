# SQL Cancer Treatments Data Project
**Beginner SQL project: Data Cleaning + Exploratory Data Analysis**

## About this project:
This is my first SQL portfolio project. I worked with a cancer patient dataset to practice SQL data cleaning and exploratory data analysis(EDA).
The goal of this project was to improve my SQL skills by cleaning messy data, checking for errors, and using SQL series to understand patterns in the dataset.
This project was built using **MySQL Workbench.**

# Skills Demonstrated:
- Basic SQL
- Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Remove duplicates
- Descriptive analysis
- Grouping and aggregation
- Creating new columns
- Working with dates
- Writing readable SQL scripts
  
## Files in This Project:
**SQL data cleaning projects.sql**
All SQL queries used for cleaning:
- Checking duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing formats
- Fixing invalid values

### **EDA sql project.sql**
- All queries used for analysis:
- Gender distribution
- Age patterns
- Most common cancer types
- Recovery status summaries
- Country and region trends
- Outlier checks

  **cancer_patients_dataset.sql**
  Dataset imported into MySQL

  ## Summary of Findings (From EDA)
  - Most patients were between ages 20-84
  - Cervical cancer was the most common cancer type
  - Recovery rate was 29%
  - Patients from Western Region had the longest treatment duration
  - Annual income ranged widely, with no outlier seen
 
  ## What I Learned
  - How to clean real-world data
  - How to write SQL queries for insight discovery
  - How to structure a project like a professional data analyst
  - How to use GitHub for portfolio documentation
